TODO

each charater is made of two parts, text and subscript.
these two parts are stored sepretly and conbined when rendering.

Rules:
1. all text most be unique in every rotations
2. all text must be capitable of holding subscript.
3. all text must be composed of straght lines.
4. all subscript must be composed of curved shapes.

charater encoding:
each charater can be repecented in 8 or 16 bits. 

the first bit of every char, starting left to right,
is a flage for how many bits this charater will use.

0 = 8 bits.
1 = 16 bits.

case 8:

next two bits code how many times to rotation the text.
next two bits code the subscript: see table 1.


case 16:

next two bits code how many times to rotation the text.
